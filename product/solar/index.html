          <h5>GPCU (On Grid PCU with MPPT Charger):</h5>
          <p>When you want to depend only on Solar Power, or for high power solar applications such as solar power plants, you can use this extremely rugged and highly intelligent PCU. This uses a MPPT charge controller which has a peak efficiency > 95% and harnesses all the input sources – Solar, Battery, Grid power / DG – in the most economical and application friendly way. You can connect any kind of critical load since it uses an Online topology. The most fascinating feature of this PCU is that when solar is available, the grid doesn’t get switched off and grid power is also not used for charging or for load. Also batteries do not get discharged when solar is available. Solar chargers the batteries and also powers the load. When solar is not available, you have a choice of using the Mains or battery. Battery capacity could be very low, if you do not want to store the power.</p>

          <h5>PCCU (Off-Grid PCU with PWM Charger)</h5>
          <p>This is just one of its kind PCU / Solar Hybrid UPS available in India with true current sharing between Grid and Solar most effectively and efficiently. When the Solar is available, the grid power will not be used for battery charging for the load. Load works from Solar power. Mains will be used only when the battery voltage is below a preset voltage (adjustable). When mains is on, Solar and Mains do not load each other like in other UPSs, but the charging is done with the intelligently shared current. An outstanding feature is that if the UPS gets overloaded while working on Solar, the load gets shifted to Mains, automatically. Again when the Battery charge reaches a preset high level, Mains is cut off and the load gets shifted to Solar/Battery.</p>
          <p>The output is pure Sinewave and all other regular features in a Home UPS are available in this as well. Our proprietary features such as Hot swappability of batteries, SMPS charger on mains and anti MOSFET blast lock and our famed ‘safest short circuit protection’ etc also are incorporated.</p>

          <h5>iSo CCu (intelligent Solar Conversion and Control Unit):</h5>
          <p>This is our Flagship product in our Solar range. iSoCCU is meant for converting any existing UPS/Inverter into an efficient Solar Inverter. The most outstanding feature of this product is that it controls not just the mains (EB) voltage but also the Mains Charger which is in the existing inverter. This is achieved by a Patent pending technology which simplifies a complex algorithm connecting the Mains-UPS Charger-UPS output-DC Load-AC load & Battery. By tracking the battery voltage based on multiple parameters, this unit intelligently disconnects-reconnects DC Load, Mains voltage and the Mains charger, automatically.</p>
